const JSON_RESPONSE_INSTRUCTION = `

CRITICAL RESPONSE FORMAT:
- Return ONLY valid JSON
- NO markdown code blocks (no \`\`\`json or \`\`\`)
- NO explanations before or after the JSON
- NO comments within the JSON
- Start response with { and end with }
- Complete the entire JSON structure
- Validate JSON syntax before returning
- DO NOT nest your response inside fields like "email_migration_research" or "research_findings"
- Use a flat structure with top-level fields

CRITICAL FOR URLS:
- Always use properly formatted URLs (e.g., "https://example.com")
- Never use double quotes within double quotes (e.g., ""https://example.com"")
- If you don't know the exact URL, use "https://example.com" as a placeholder
- Format URLs in sources as: { "url": "https://example.com", "title": "Source Title" }

CRITICAL FOR NESTED STRUCTURES:
- Ensure all arrays and objects are properly closed
- Check that all opening braces { have matching closing braces }
- Check that all opening brackets [ have matching closing brackets ]
- Ensure all property names are in double quotes
- Ensure all string values are in double quotes

RESPOND WITH PURE JSON ONLY.

Your task is to conduct comprehensive research and provide 5-7 specific, real sources that would be valuable for understanding this topic.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Return a JSON object with this EXACT structure:
{
  "sources": [
    {
      "url": "https://www.example.com/specific-page",
      "title": "Title of the source",
      "relevance": "Brief explanation of relevance",
      "category": "Source category"
    }
  ]
}

2. For each source:
   - Provide REAL URLs to actual websites that exist
   - Include specific titles that accurately reflect the content
   - Briefly explain why each source is relevant
   - Categorize each source (Vendor Documentation, Industry Resource, etc.)

3. Focus on authoritative sources like:
   - Official vendor documentation
   - Industry analyst reports
   - Technical blogs from recognized experts
   - Professional organizations and standards bodies

4. For technology topics, prioritize:
   - Official vendor documentation (e.g., cisco.com for Cisco products)
   - Industry analyst reports (Gartner, Forrester)
   - Technical implementation guides
   - Best practices documents

IMPORTANT: Return ONLY valid JSON with NO additional text or explanation. Start with { and end with }.`;

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. You MUST use the specific terminology, tools, and methodologies found in the research data

3. Use the exact questions and service components found in the research data when available
4. Include specific tools, platforms, and methodologies mentioned in the research in your service descriptions
5. Reference industry best practices found in the research data
6. Base your hour estimates on the research findings, not generic templates

DISCOVERY QUESTIONS REQUIREMENTS:
- Generate AT LEAST 10 highly specific discovery questions for ${parsedData.technology || input}
- Each question must include technology-specific terminology from the research
- Questions must cover technical, business, and operational aspects
- Each question must have 3-4 options that are specific to the technology
- Options must include realistic values/choices relevant to ${parsedData.technology || input}
- NO generic questions - each question must be uniquely tailored to ${parsedData.technology || input}
- Questions should reference specific components, versions, configurations of ${parsedData.technology || input}

SERVICE REQUIREMENTS:
- Generate at least 10 services across all phases (Planning, Design, Implementation, Testing, Go-Live, Support)
- Each service must have exactly 3 subservices
- Each service and subservice must have a UNIQUE name specific to ${parsedData.technology || input}
- NO generic service names - use specific technology terms from research
- Each service description must be unique and specific to the service
- Vary the language and structure across different services
- Include specific tools, methodologies, and components in service names

IMPORTANT: Return ONLY valid JSON. Start with { and end with }. Do not include any markdown code blocks or explanations.
Your response MUST be a valid JSON object with the following structure:

CRITICAL: Use the EXACT terminology, tools, methodologies, and best practices from the research data.

UNIQUENESS REQUIREMENTS:
1. Each service and subservice must have a COMPLETELY UNIQUE description
2. Vary the sentence structure, length, and style across different services
3. Use different terminology and phrasing for each service
4. No two services should follow the same descriptive pattern
5. Incorporate specific technical terms from the research in different ways
6. Vary the focus (business value, technical details, operational benefits) across services

Make each service and subservice more specific to ${parsedData.technology || input} by:
1. Adding technology-specific terminology from the research data
2. Including industry-standard methodologies mentioned in the research
3. Referencing specific tools or processes used in ${parsedData.technology || input} implementations
4. Ensuring descriptions clearly explain the value/purpose using industry-specific language
5. Using the exact service components and terminology found in the research

CRITICAL: Return ONLY a valid JSON array of services. Start with [ and end with ].
Ensure all property names and string values use double quotes.
Do not add any explanations or markdown formatting.${JSON_RESPONSE_INSTRUCTION}`
